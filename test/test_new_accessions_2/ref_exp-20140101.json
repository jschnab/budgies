Thermo-sensitive genic male sterility (TGMS) lines, which are male-sterile at restrictive (high) temperatures but convert to male-fertile at permissive (low) temperatures, have been widely utilized in two-line hybrid rice breeding3. However, the molecular mechanism underlying TGMS remains unclear. Here we show that the rice (Oryza sativa L.) thermo-sensitive genic male sterile gene 5 (tms5) locus, which in 2010 was present in cultivars occupying more than 70% (2.4 million hectares) of two-line hybrid rice-growing land in China, confers the TGMS trait through a loss-of-function mutation of RNase ZS1, resulting in failure to mediate mRNA decay of three temperature-responsive ubiquitin fusion ribosomal protein L40 genes (UbL40). TMS5 encodes an evolutionarily conserved endonuclease, RNase ZS1. RNase ZS1 can process tRNAs in vitro, but does not do so in vivo due to its localization in the cytoplasm. Defective RNase ZS1 in tms5 plants leads to over-accumulation of UbL401, UbL402 and UbL404 mRNAs at restrictive but not permissive temperatures. Furthermore, over-expression of UbL401 and UbL404 in wild-type plants causes male sterility, while knockdown of UbL401 and UbL404 in tms5 partially restores its fertility. Our results uncover a novel mechanism of RNase ZS1-mediated UbL40 mRNA decay which controls TGMS in rice and has potential applications in hybrid breeding not only of rice but also of other crops.

Among these, 34 DES were predicted to target 176 transcripts, of which 112 encoded 94 transcription factors. Further analysis showed that 67.6% of DES expression levels were negatively correlated with their target mRNAs either in flag leaves or panicles. The target genes of DES were significantly enriched in some important biological processes, including the auxin signalling pathway, in which existed a regulatory network mediated by DES and their targets, closely associated with plant growth and development. Overall, 20.8% of DES and their target genes were significantly enriched in quantitative trait loci of small intervals related to important rice agronomic traits including growth vigour, grain yield, and plant architecture, suggesting that the interaction between sRNAs and their targets contributes to the heterotic phenotypes of hybrid rice. Our findings revealed that sRNAs might play important roles in hybrid vigour of super-hybrid rice by regulating their target genes, especially in controlling the auxin signalling pathway. The above finding provides a novel insight into the molecular mechanism of heterosis.

Different TEs are tightly regulated by distinct epigenetic mechanisms. For example, the activities of LTR retrotransposon Tos17 and non-LTR retrotransposon LINE element Karma are uniquely regulated by histone H3K9 methylation and histone H3K4 demethylation, respectively. Miniature inverted repeat transposable elements (MITEs) are one of the most high-copy-number DNA transposons, which are interspersed around rice genome and might influence nearby gene expression. In plants, 24-nucleotide (24-nt) heterochromatic small interfering RNAs (hc-siRNAs) derived from repeats and TEs. To what extent hc-siRNA associated TEs affect gene expression and therefore contribute to agricultural traits in rice remains elusive. Here, we show that OsDCL3a, one of Dicer-Like 3 (DCL3) homolog, is primarily responsible for 24-nt hc-siRNA processing in rice. Impaired OsDCL3a displayed altered important agricultural traits in rice. We found that genome-wide (281,563) 24-nt hc-siRNA clusters were OsDCL3a-dependent, among which MITEs were significantly enriched. Impaired OsDCL3a caused significant overlapping between reduced hc-siRNAs from MITEs and elevated nearby gene expression. Intriguingly, genes involved in Gibberellin and Brassinosteroid homeostasis were identified as direct targets of OsDCL3a, which may attribute to dwarfism and enlarged flag leaf angle upon OsDCL3a deficiency. Our work uncovers OsDCL3a-dependent hc-siRNAs derived from MITEs as broad spectrum of regulators for fine-tuning gene expression, and this observation may reflect a conserved mechanism in other higher plants with dispersed repeat- or TE-rich genomes.
