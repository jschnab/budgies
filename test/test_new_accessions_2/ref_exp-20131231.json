Here, we performed sRNA profiling of F1 super-hybrid rice LYP9 and its parents using high-throughput sequencing technology, and identified 355 distinct mature microRNAs and trans-acting small interfering RNAs, 69 of which were differentially expressed sRNAs (DES) between the hybrid and the mid-parental value. Among these, 34 DES were predicted to target 176 transcripts, of which 112 encoded 94 transcription factors. Further analysis showed that 67.6% of DES expression levels were negatively correlated with their target mRNAs either in flag leaves or panicles. The target genes of DES were significantly enriched in some important biological processes, including the auxin signalling pathway, in which existed a regulatory network mediated by DES and their targets, closely associated with plant growth and development. Overall, 20.8% of DES and their target genes were significantly enriched in quantitative trait loci of small intervals related to important rice agronomic traits including growth vigour, grain yield, and plant architecture, suggesting that the interaction between sRNAs and their targets contributes to the heterotic phenotypes of hybrid rice. Our findings revealed that sRNAs might play important roles in hybrid vigour of super-hybrid rice by regulating their target genes, especially in controlling the auxin signalling pathway. The above finding provides a novel insight into the molecular mechanism of heterosis. We constructed six sRNA sequencing libraries and six mRNA sequencing libraries of flag leaves and panicles of the super-hybrid rice Liangyou-pei9 (LYP9) combination at the grain-filling stage. The above hybrid rice combination includes F1 hybrid LYP9 and its parental lines including the male-sterile line Peiai64s (PA64s) and the restorer line 93-11."}], "provider": [{"contact": "Yan Dai", "role": null, "email": null}, {"contact": "Zhen Zhu", "role": "submitter", "email": "zzhu@genetics.ac.cn"}, {"contact": "Dawei Yuan", "role": null, "email": null}, {"contact": "Yonggang Peng", "role": null, "email": null}, {"contact": "Yangyang Pan", "role": null, "email": null}, {"contact": "Lei Zhang", "role": null, "email": null}, {"contact": "Xiaoli Wei", "role": null, "email": null}, {"contact": "Yufei Lu", "role": null, "email": null}], "bibliography": [{"accession": 25129133, "authors": "Zhang L, Peng Y, Wei X, Dai Y, Yuan D, Lu Y, Pan Y, Zhu Z", "title": "Small RNAs as important regulators for the hybrid vigour of super-hybrid rice.", "doi": "10.1093/jxb/eru337"}], "samplecharacteristic": [{"category": "developmental stage", "value": ["whole plant fruit formation stage"]}, {"category": "genotype", "value": ["LYP9 hybrid", "restorer line 93-11", "sterile line PA64s"]}, {"category": "growth condition", "value": ["field study"]}, {"category": "organism", "value": ["Oryza sativa"]}, {"category": "organism part", "value": ["flag leaf", "inflorescence"]}], "experimentalvariable": [{"name": "genotype", "value": ["LYP9 hybrid", "restorer line 93-11", "sterile line PA64s"]}, {"name": "organism part", "value": ["flag leaf", "inflorescence"]}, {"name": "protocol", "value": ["RNA-seq of coding RNA", "RNA-seq of non coding RNA"]}], "protocol": [{"id": 1192332, "accession": "P-GSE51468-3"}, {"id": 1192333, "accession": "P-GSE51468-2"}, {"id": 1192334, "accession": "P-GSE51468-1"}], "bioassaydatagroup": [{"id": null, "name": "processedData", "bioassaydatacubes": 12, "arraydesignprovider": null, "dataformat": "processedData", "bioassays": 12, "isderived": 0}, {"id": null, "name": "scan", "bioassaydatacubes": 12, "arraydesignprovider": null, "dataformat": "scan", "bioassays": 12, "isderived": 0}]}, {"id": 538130, "accession": "E-GEOD-55234", "secondaryaccession": ["SRP038713", "GSE55234"], "name": "Transcription profiling by high throughput sequencing of rice transgenic plants overexpressing the NLS-truncated form of OsNMD3", "releasedate": "2014-05-21", "lastupdatedate": "2016-04-13", "organism": ["Oryza sativa"], "experimenttype": ["RNA-seq of coding RNA"], "description": [{"id": null, "text": "Plants have mechanisms that coordinate protein synthesis and gene transcription, although they operate at different cellular sites.

Different TEs are tightly regulated by distinct epigenetic mechanisms. For example, the activities of LTR retrotransposon Tos17 and non-LTR retrotransposon LINE element Karma are uniquely regulated by histone H3K9 methylation and histone H3K4 demethylation, respectively. Miniature inverted repeat transposable elements (MITEs) are one of the most high-copy-number DNA transposons, which are interspersed around rice genome and might influence nearby gene expression. In plants, 24-nucleotide (24-nt) heterochromatic small interfering RNAs (hc-siRNAs) derived from repeats and TEs. To what extent hc-siRNA associated TEs affect gene expression and therefore contribute to agricultural traits in rice remains elusive. Here, we show that OsDCL3a, one of Dicer-Like 3 (DCL3) homolog, is primarily responsible for 24-nt hc-siRNA processing in rice. Impaired OsDCL3a displayed altered important agricultural traits in rice. We found that genome-wide (281,563) 24-nt hc-siRNA clusters were OsDCL3a-dependent, among which MITEs were significantly enriched. Impaired OsDCL3a caused significant overlapping between reduced hc-siRNAs from MITEs and elevated nearby gene expression. Intriguingly, genes involved in Gibberellin and Brassinosteroid homeostasis were identified as direct targets of OsDCL3a, which may attribute to dwarfism and enlarged flag leaf angle upon OsDCL3a deficiency. Our work uncovers OsDCL3a-dependent hc-siRNAs derived from MITEs as broad spectrum of regulators for fine-tuning gene expression, and this observation may reflect a conserved mechanism in other higher plants with dispersed repeat- or TE-rich genomes.
